=== BG-Black (Primitive)
#This is just used to fill in the background color so you don't see any 3D model coming through from the Scene layer, if there is any showing.
#This is basically a scaled up PlaneHrz pimitive entity.
#You can change the color by selecting the entity and changing the diffuse color in the material editor.
